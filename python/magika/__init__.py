"""Magika: AI-powered file type detection.

Magika uses a deep learning model to detect the content type of files with
high accuracy, even for files that are difficult to identify using traditional
rule-based approaches.

Basic usage:
    >>> from magika import Magika
    >>> m = Magika()
    >>> result = m.identify_bytes(b"# Hello\nprint('world')")
    >>> print(result.output.ct_label)
    'python'
